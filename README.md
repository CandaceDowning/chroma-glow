This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `CHROMA-GLOW`

An arcade simulator designed to encourage studying of vocabulary. Originally designed with color theory vocabulary in mind, but there are future plans to add an administrator side for setting up accounts so students can access their teachers questions, and they can play against each other.  


### `A full stack personal project that utilizes:`
React,
Redux,
Node,
Massive,
Express-Session,
Axios,
Sass,
Chart.js,

With future plans to add a drag and drop package.



### `Purpose`

To establish a foundation for full stack development from front end design and UX to back end functionality. This project was created in 3 weeks, so the scope had to remain small, but many other features are possible in the future; like teams, more mini games, and completing the drag and drop functionality of the color slider game.
